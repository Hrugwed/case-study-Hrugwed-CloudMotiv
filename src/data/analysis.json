      "No extraordinary or one-off items affecting EBITDA were reported in Maersk’s Q2 2025 results.",
      "The report explicitly notes that EBITDA improvements stemmed from operational performance—including volume growth, cost control, and margin improvement across Ocean, Logistics & Services, and Terminals segments [1][2].",
      "Gains or losses from asset sales, which could qualify as extraordinary items, are shown separately under EBIT and not included in EBITDA. The gain on sale of non-current assets was USD 25 m in Q2 2025, significantly lower than USD 208 m in Q2 2024, but these affect EBIT, not EBITDA [3]. Hence, Q2 2025 EBITDA reflects core operating activities without one-off extraordinary adjustments."
